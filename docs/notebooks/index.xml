      <description>Eric Busboom, 7 Nov 2017
In preparation for the SCALE and Open San Diego Crime ANalysis Presentation, I downloaded the data package for the presentation and started on the analysis a bit early.
The presentation will use the San Diego Police 2015 calls for service, but the data repository has 2016 and 2017 as well. The seperate files for each of the three years are converted into a data package on our repository, and I also created Metapack packages for the boundary files for beats, neighborhoods and districts.</description>

      <description>Metatab is a system for documenting data set metadata, which the program metapack uses to create data packages. You can also us the metapack python module to access data packages from the web, which provides easy access to documentation and pandas data frames in Jupyter notebooks.
To start, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to install metatab, which you should be able to do with:
 pip install metatab
 The system is under active development, so if there are problems, you can install the latest development versions of the important modules with the development requirements.</description>
